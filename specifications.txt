-Unit Test
    1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input .
        -Expect multiplication(5, 5) to be a number
        -Expect multiplication(5, 5) to be 25
        -Expect multiplication("5", 5) to be an error
        -Expect multiplication(5, 5) to return a value

    2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both the arrays.
        -Expect concatOdds([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) to be [1,3,5]
        -Expect concatOdds([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) to be an array
        -Expect concatOdds([1,2,3], 3) to return a string saying invalid inputs
        -Expect concatOdds([1,2,3], "hillo") to return a string saying invalid inputs
        -Expect concatOdds([1,2,3], [4,5,6,5]) to be [1,3,5]
        -Expect concatOdds([2,4,6], [8, 10, 12]) to be []
        -Expect concatOdds([1,1,1], [1,1,1]) to be [1]
